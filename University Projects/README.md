# Lagrange Interpolation
This repository contains a Python script for performing Lagrange interpolation on a given set of points. The script uses the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries for numerical computations and plotting.

## Results
- The entered points will be displayed in the console.
- The Lagrange interpolation polynomial will be plotted along with the selected coordinates.

The script is initialized with sample data for demonstration purposes. Feel free to modify the X and Y arrays with your own set of points.
