# Titanic Disaster Analysis and Model Comparison

## Project Description
This project focuses on the analysis of Titanic disaster data and the comparison of various machine learning models to predict survival based on the available data.

## Data Preparation
In the notebooks, you will find steps related to:
- Data analysis and identification of missing values.
- Data cleansing and outlier removal.

## Model Comparison
Comparison of different machine learning models:
1. Dummy Model: Basic model for baseline evaluation.
2. Logistic Regression: Classic classification model.
3. Random Forest: Model based on the decision tree principle.
4. Gradient Boosting: Utilizing gradient boosting for modeling.
